/*
 *  Logger is a singleton that grants access to the logging system via Logger::getInstance(). 
 *  It instantiates a logging implmenentation and returns it as AbstractLogger. 
 *  The logging system persists database changes to disk that can be used to recover after startup.
 *  A logging implementation therefore provides following functions:
 *    - commit(...)
 *    - value(...)
 *    - invalidate(...)
 *    - flush()
 *    - recover()
 * 
 *  If you want to turn logging off, you need to set NoLogger as the logging implementation.
 * 
 *  When implementing a NewLogger it needs to fullfill following requirements:
 *    -  NewLogger has to be a child of AbstractLogger
 *    -  NewLogger has to implement the methods declared by AbstractLogger
 *    -  The constructor of NewLogger should be private and Logger declared as friend of NewLogger
 *    -  delete copy and copy-assign constructors
 *    -  NewLogger has to be instantiated in Logger::getInstance()
 * 
 *  A new logfile is created on each startup and numbered in ascending order (path = directory + filename + <number>)
